# CS445 (Cyber Threat Intelligence) Group Project

## Group Project Description

With the rise in data exfiltration during ransomware attacks came a rise in "shaming" websites, which are leverage by threat actors to extort victims into paying the ransom.
Shaming websites are used by threat actors as a tool to publicly name victims and post stolen data in an effort to extort them into paying the ransom demand.
